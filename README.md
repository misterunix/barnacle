# barnacle

## The Name
What a name right? When creating this repo Github showed **overland-barnacle**. Just had to use barnacle!


## What is it?
Transformations for 2D and 3D(maybe)

## Why?
Working on an artistic image project, I needed transformations, translate, scale & rotate to achieve the results I need. Since I am starting to create public libraries, why not?

## What is there?

- types
    - Points
    - Triangle

- Generic Transforms
    - translate
    - rotate
    - scale

- Triangle
    - calculate center
    - translate
    - rotate
    - scale


## Contribs?

Sure, if they only require the standard Go library. Let's do it.

## Formatting

Clarity over cleverness!

## Conduct

Treat this as if your grandma is in the room. Keep it civil.
